//There are three classes:
         //Fish - can swim
         //Duck - can swim and fly
         //Airplane - can fly
         //Create an instance of each class, creating interfaces
         //Throw swimmers into the pool (only objects that can swim can be in it)
         //Send flying people into the sky (only objects that can fly can be in it)
